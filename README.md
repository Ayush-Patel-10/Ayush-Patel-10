<h2> My Skills üòÄ:</h2>

I learned to code from a young age. I learned **"C"** language and now I'm learning **python** which gives me an edge for understanding machine learning and data science. As a result, I was able to learn and understand the code well. Later, I also learned various other programming languages such as **"R"** which were important in order to become a **machine learning engineer** or a **data scientist**. Below are the list of some of my skills that I've gained throughout my experience of working with data science and machine learning. Learning these important **tools** and **techniques** helped me build **machine learning projects** and understand their working in full detail. Feel free to take a look.
